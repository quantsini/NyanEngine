This is my final project for CprE 557: Computer Graphics and Geometric Modelling.
It is a survey of modern rendering techniques used in modern 3D graphics engine.
The goal is to learn OpenGL Shaders through these techniques. This project uses jBullet for physics, and reads STL files for models.
Techniques used:
* Depth of Field
* Shadow Volume Shadows
* Postprocessing effects
   - Bloom
   - Gaussian Blur
   - Gamma Correction

The code could be better refactored, and some parts could be rewritten or renamed to better describe the function of each class.
Main.java contains the entry point, and World.java contains the rendering code as well as physics simulation.
